<p align="center">
Project Description: This project requires you to develop a simple blog application. You need to create a website where users can sign up, log in and create blog posts. You also need to add a comment system where users can like and comment on other users' blog posts.
    </p>
<p align="center">
Project Done: I built the project using Laravel, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4.
In the project, I added registration, login, profile update, password change, blogging, commenting, blog liking. Only registered members can add and view blogs. A cross-user role has been added, so that certain users can access the admin panel. Blogs are listed in the order they were added.
Admin panel authority has been given the authority to edit, delete, activate-deactivate and edit, delete, activate-deactivate the added comments of the blogs added by the members.
When a member is deleted, their blog, comments and likes are also deleted.</p>
